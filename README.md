### The Knapsack Problem

In this project, I will be using Java in order to implement the Greedy Stays Ahead algorithm/reasoning that ensures the optimization of a bag that can hold *n* weight with *x* available objects of various *y* weight where 0\<y\<=n and various z values. As such, the goal will be to maximize value from a generated list of objects and a bag with capacity.
